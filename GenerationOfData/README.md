This directory contains python codes for the simulation of Lorenz '96 system.

The resulting states are raw data for training of the model.

The generated data needs to be transformed into npy files by a python code so that it can be used for training within the framework.
If you need the code please contact me (seoleuns@kriss.re.kr)

Otherwise, you can customize the code included in the DiffSTG.
