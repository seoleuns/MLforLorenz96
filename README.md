# MLforLorenz96

The related manuscript has been submitted to Scientific Reports.

This repository will be updated further as the revision progresses.

The directory "Model" provides codes for the default ML prediction for Lorenz '96 system.

The size of Numpy Array Datasets is quite large and I will provide them upon request or will upload necessary source codes soon. (Contact Info: seoleuns@kriss.re.kr)
