# MLforLorenz96

The related manuscript has been submitted to Scientific Reports.

This repository will be updated further as the revision progresses.

The directory "Model" provides codes for the default ML prediction for Lorenz '96 system.

The Framework is based on the DiffSTG at https://github.com/wenhaomin/DiffSTG

Changes for the applications to the Lorenz '96 system have been made:

1. Addition of an Attention Mechanism 
2. Unnormalized scale of data
3. Addition of data assimilation process
4. A New Sampling strategy during the reverse processes in DDIM and DDPM 
5. Use of diverse evaluation Metrics for Time series Data

The size of Numpy Array Datasets is quite large and I will provide them upon request or will upload necessary source codes soon.
