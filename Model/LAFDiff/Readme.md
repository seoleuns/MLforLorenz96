This is the Framework which uses the concept of LAF in its DDIM or DDPM reverse process

I will be uploading the code to this repository soon after the first decision.
The reason for this delay is to secure the novelty of my work before it is publicly shared.

The main idea of using LAF is included in the model.py of the 'algorithm' directory.

If you have questions, feel free to contact me.
